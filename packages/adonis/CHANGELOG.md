## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#8](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/pull/8) [`8763c29`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/commit/8763c29c43c4f766bc3f80e25d6e19f4e0c8aa6e) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Fix `app/agent_tools` discovery registering nothing in a dev/TypeScript app

  The `app/agent_tools` scanner picked which module extension to import from
  `extname(import.meta.url)` — the extension of the SCANNER's own file. Since the
  package ships compiled (`.js`), that was always `.js`, so an app running from
  TypeScript source under a loader (`app/agent_tools/*.ts`, no build barrel wired)
  had its directory scanned for `.js` files, matched none, and registered zero
  tools — the agent silently ran with an empty `ToolRegistry`.

  The extension is now derived from what the scanned directory actually holds
  (`.ts` when it has any non-declaration `.ts` file, else `.js`). At runtime an app
  runs from EITHER its source or its build — never both in one directory — so this
  still guarantees a built `.js` and a dev `.ts` of the same module never
  double-register. `.d.ts` declarations are still skipped.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/pull/6) [`363382b`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/commit/363382b5bd182f8de6184cd1c509209113710111) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - `pricingStore` and `governanceQueries` now default to mirroring the main `store`.

  When `store` is a `stores.lucid()` store, the agent now defaults the pricing store and the governance read-model to a Lucid store on the **same connection** (tables auto-created) with no extra config — so cost tracking and the `/agent/governance/*` routes work out of the box. Previously both were opt-in and omitting them left cost `null` and the governance routes unmounted.

  - Override by passing a factory/instance as before (e.g. a different connection, or `pricingStores.memory()` for tests).
  - Set `pricingStore: false` / `governanceQueries: false` to disable (cost stays `null`; governance routes not mounted).
  - When the main store is not Lucid, both stay off unless set explicitly.

  Adds `lucidStoreConnection(factory)` to read a `stores.lucid()` factory's connection (used internally for the mirroring). The `@adonis-agora/agent` peer range on `@adonis-agora/agent-dashboard` widens to `^0.4.0`.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- [#4](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/pull/4) [`487ad72`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/commit/487ad7265d512ab27b67a5b25802591f8719923c) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - Fix an app-boot crash when configuring the Lucid store, pricing store, or governance read-model via the factory helpers.

  `stores.lucid()`, `pricingStores.lucid()`, `governanceQueries.lucid()`, and the pgvector retriever resolved the Lucid `Database` from `@adonisjs/lucid/services/db`'s default export. AdonisJS assigns that default only inside `app.booted()` — after every provider's `boot()` — but the agent provider builds these stores eagerly during its own `boot()`, so the default was still `undefined` and `db.connection(...)` threw a `TypeError`, failing the whole app boot. They now resolve the `Database` from the container via the `'lucid.db'` alias (registered in the database provider's `register()`, so it is available during boot) — the same binding `services/db` itself resolves. No public API change.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- [#2](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/pull/2) [`3ed796f`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/commit/3ed796f5106416726526651088fb98c1d2495172) Thanks [@DavideCarvalho](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho)! - `autoCreateTables` now defaults to **`true`** for the Lucid stores — the agent lib manages its own
  schema by default, completing the ecosystem convention (mirrors `@adonis-agora/durable` and
  `@adonis-agora/authz`). On first use a store provisions the six shared agent tables with `CREATE
TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`; set `autoCreateTables: false` (on `stores.lucid`, `pricingStores.lucid`, or
  `governanceQueries.lucid`) to opt out and run the published migration instead.

  Crucially, provisioning is no longer the agent store's job alone: the **pricing store** and the
  **governance read-model** also auto-provision on first use, sharing one memoized `CREATE TABLE` pass
  per db client (new exported `ensureAgentTables`). This closes two real gaps — seeding model prices
  before the first agent run, and opening the governance dashboard on a fresh deploy — that the
  store-only auto-create left broken.

  The dashboard's peer range is bumped to `@adonis-agora/agent@^0.3.0`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`f1fea00`](https://github.com/DavideCarvalho/adonis-agent/commit/f1fea00e165ef6d106fa67ed9ceda6e03ddbca3b) - Suporta `@adonis-agora/durable` 0.8.x (o peer passa de `^0.7.0` para `^0.8.0`).

  O durable 0.8.0 removeu o decorator `@Workflow`, que o `AgentRunWorkflow` usava, em favor de
  `BaseWorkflow` + `static workflow = { name, version }`. Instalar agent 0.1.0 ao lado de durable
  0.8.0 derrubava o modo durable inteiro — `TypeError: (0 , Workflow) is not a function` ao carregar
  o módulo, com o provider caindo silenciosamente no runner inline. O `^0.7.0` barrava a combinação,
  então ninguém instalou os dois juntos; o preço era ficar preso ao durable 0.7.

  O `AgentRunWorkflow` agora estende `BaseWorkflow` e declara `static workflow`. O resto da
  integração (`WorkflowEngine.start/signal/cancel`, `registerWorkflowClass`, `WorkflowSuspended`,
  `ContinueAsNew`, `WorkflowCtx`) não mudou.

  O bug nasceu de um vão de teste: o `durable` não era devDependency, então o lockfile resolvia
  0.7.0 e a suíte exercitava o runner durable contra a versão antiga — verde e cega para o 0.8.0.
  Agora é devDependency em `^0.8.0`, e os testes rodam contra a mesma versão que o peer promete.
