Fix an app-boot crash when configuring the Lucid store, pricing store, or governance read-model via the factory helpers.

`stores.lucid()`, `pricingStores.lucid()`, `governanceQueries.lucid()`, and the pgvector retriever resolved the Lucid `Database` from `@adonisjs/lucid/services/db`'s default export. AdonisJS assigns that default only inside `app.booted()` — after every provider's `boot()` — but the agent provider builds these stores eagerly during its own `boot()`, so the default was still `undefined` and `db.connection(...)` threw a `TypeError`, failing the whole app boot. They now resolve the `Database` from the container via the `'lucid.db'` alias (registered in the database provider's `register()`, so it is available during boot) — the same binding `services/db` itself resolves. No public API change.
